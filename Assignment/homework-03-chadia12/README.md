## React programming exercise
We need to count the characters a user type in a text area, just like Twitter's tweet form. With each character the user types we need to update the UI with the new count of characters. 
1. Build a class based component that is limited ton characters per tweet, passed to the component as props.  
Example: `<LimitedTextArea characters="200" />`
2. Use the component in the app with show/hide button to toggle the component
